Cucumber with Java works by defining feature files in Gherkin syntax.
These feature files contain scenarios with steps that are associated with step definitions.
When a test is executed, the framework matches the steps in the scenario to their corresponding step definitions,
which execute the code to perform the desired behavior.
To execute specific suites with tags using Maven commands in Cucumber,
you need to specify the tags in the runner class.
For example, you can specify "@smoke" tag to run only the smoke test suite or "@regression" tag to run only the regression test suite.
To execute the specific suites with tags using Maven commands, you need to add the following command line options to your Maven command:
mvn test -Dcucumber.options="--tags @TagName"
